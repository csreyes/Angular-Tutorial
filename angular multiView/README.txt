This is a an example of a single state with multiple children states inside it done with angular. 

It behaves as such:
      mainState{ firstChild{ whatever you want here  }, secondChild {  whatever you want here   }, thirdChild{ whatever you want here }    }

This is an extremely powerful feature of ui-router and angular. This ultimately will allow you to have a fully responsive single page app as each feature is a state of its own. This modular design allows for very easy scalability and easy of development.
